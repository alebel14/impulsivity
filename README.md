# implusivity

This code was built for my Spring Rotation in the Collins lab. It is looking at 
the effects of Impulsivity on an RLWM task. 

There are 3 important jupyter notebooks in the analysis pipeline:

## - [Data Visualization](https://github.com/alebel14/implusivity/blob/main/Data%20visualization.ipynb)
This notebook does the basic analysis of the behavioral data

## - [RL Implementation](https://github.com/alebel14/implusivity/blob/main/RL%20Implementation.ipynb)
This notebook is all of the simulation code and analyses

## - [Model Fitting](https://github.com/alebel14/implusivity/blob/main/Model%20fitting.ipynb)
This notebook is used for fitting the RL models to the behavioral data with corresponding analyses
